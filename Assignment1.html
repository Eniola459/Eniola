    <h1>Coding is Interesting</h1>
    <p>Lots of people code for fun, and for many different reasons. 
        For some people, it's the fun of building an applicationâ€”the result is what matters. For others, it's the process of creating something that works. 
        Coding can be very engaging. </p>
